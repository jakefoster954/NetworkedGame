TODO
1. LEAVING LOBBY ONCE GAME HAS STARTED CRASHES GAME SINCE SERVER. LEAVELOBBY USES THE ARRAYLIST IN LOBBY. THE LOBBY NO LONGER EXISTS. THIS CAN BE FIXED BY USING A DIFFERENT COMMAND ONCE THE GAME HAS STARTED. SERVER COULD ALSO HAVE AN ARRAY OF GAMES THAT ARE IN PROGRESS!
2. USER INPUT IS NOT LINKED TO THE USER. THIS IS A PROBLEM!

IMPORTANT
NEED TO SEND TILE MAP THEN THE GAME DATA!

Playing around with the structure of game data and the data storage client side (Database)

GRAPHICS
need to add a starting state to the gsm. currently index out of bounds (get state(0))!
