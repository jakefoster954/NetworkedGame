1. LEAVING LOBBY ONCE GAME HAS STARTED CRASHES GAME SINCE SERVER. LEAVELOBBY USES THE ARRAYLIST IN LOBBY. THE LOBBY NO LONGER EXISTS. THIS CAN BE FIXED BY USING A DIFFERENT COMMAND ONCE THE GAME HAS STARTED. SERVER COULD ALSO HAVE AN ARRAY OF GAMES THAT ARE IN PROGRESS!
2. NEVER CLOSE IN, OUT AND SOCKET SERVERSIDE. DO I NEED TO?
